# Project Title: VR Target Simulator Tool
## Abstract üìù
The VR Hand-Tracking Target Simulator is an immersive virtual reality application developed for the Meta VR headset using the Meta SDK, Unity, and C#. Leveraging advanced hand-tracking technology, the simulator allows users to interact naturally by shooting targets with their right hand, reloading weapons, and teleporting within the virtual environment. This project showcases the capabilities of hand-tracking in enhancing user interaction and providing a seamless, responsive gaming experience.

## Introduction to the Problem üí°

Creating intuitive and immersive interactions in virtual reality remains a significant challenge. Traditional VR controllers can limit the naturalness of user movements and interactions, potentially hindering the overall experience. There is a need for applications that utilize hand-tracking technology to provide more natural and engaging interactions, particularly in simulation and gaming environments where precision and responsiveness are crucial.
